PCB image as it currently exist. Still needs more work before sending to PCB shop. 
Must balance the lenth of all differential traces.
Review trace widths to make them larger where possible.
Check package outlines
Check Pinout
Make sure all Vcc and GND connections on parts are connected.
9/7/23
Updating with most task completed to support sending to PCB shop/
9/9/23
Added circuit to support watchdog for Transmitter shutdown.
Reduced pad size under AX5043 to insure not shorts.
Changed some of the part numbers assigned to schematic parts to make better since.
9/10/23
Updated PDF of schematic and PCB. Added BOM to folder.
9/14/23
Changed power supply to feed off +5VDC regulator. Added pull-up to HW_POWER_OFF_N.
Verified all Vcc, VccIO, and GND connections on CPU.
9/14/23  8:28 PM
Add A/D taps for 1.2V 3.3V and 5V power supply.
10/5/23
Added a foot print for second crystal. Made adjustments to traces and holes.
10/24/23
Based on inputs from PCB assembly house after review of footprints used
changes were made to the PCB layout to correct a few footprints. Changes were
also made the BOM to select proper parts with matching footprints because a few 1020 inductors were included and these will be difficult to solder.

Also generated 3D CAD drawings of parts to support KiCAD 3D view. Now have parts in all
locations.

Regenerated the Gerber and the drill files.

Errata does not include changes for Rev D.
