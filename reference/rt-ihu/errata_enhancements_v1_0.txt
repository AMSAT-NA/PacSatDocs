Errata for the RT-IHU v1.0 / Enhancements planned in v1.1
28-Feb-2019 Zach Metzinger N0ZGO

Erratum
-------
Bus switches (U15, U16, U13, U14, U19, U20) footprint INCORRECT/MIRRORED (do not install)
	- Fixed
Inductor needs to be changed for switching regulator (lower ESR, higher saturation)
Add pull-down on TMS570 OSCIN to prevent high-Z startup condition
	- Replaced with dedicated XTAL
Re-evaluate nERROR (FAULT_N) signal, pull up or pull down more appropriate?
Splitter/combiner for RX and TX paths
Power switch for Maxim part is EOL
	- Replace with new part

Enhancements
------------
Hardware watchdog for latch-up and software-directed power cycle (ala Fox)
Add dedicated XTAL for TMS570 (16 MHz)
Unused ADC channels to monitor voltage and current (VDD, VDD12, etc.)
RC filter on I/O pins
TCXO for AX5043
Compartmentalized RF/EMI shielding over all non-DC parts
White space for S/N on silkscreen
Encode board revision on 4 GPIO pins
SCI2 as console UART for both supervisors, unswitched, to GOLF bus
CAN as inter-supervisor link, plus a couple of discrete I/O

Wishlist
--------
Incorporate PIN scintilation detector
